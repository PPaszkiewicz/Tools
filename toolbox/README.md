Toolbox
=======
Utility classes / packages.

Most of them are copy-pasteable because they don't have any 
external dependencies. If they require another file it's specified in 
file header.

To import everything, add to **build.gradle** or **build.gradle.kts**:
```gradle    
implementation("com.github.PPaszkiewicz.Tools:toolbox:$version")
```

### Delegate
Various delegates and their factories.

**Context** - lazy context delegates useful for declaring some delegates in fragments.

**Fragment** - delegates for creating/finding existing fragments.

    // inside activity or fragment:
    val myFragment by fragments<MyFragment>()

**Preferences** - delegates for exposing preference values.

    // inside activity or fragment:
    val userPreference by preferences().boolean("key", false)

**ViewBinding** - delegate for `ViewBinding` (Android Studio 3.6+) that's lifecycle aware so it doesn't require any `onDestroyView` override.

    // inside fragment:
    val binding by viewBinding<MainActivityBinding>()

### DownloadManager
Utilities for querying download progress from systems DownloadManager.

Available as standalone `DownloadProgressObserver` or wrapped with `LiveData`.

### Extensions
Various extensions relating to whatever is in the file name.

### RecyclerView

**GravityGridLayoutManager** - grid layout manager that applies gravity to items instead of putting them at top-start.

**NestedWrapLayoutManager** - linear layout manager that can be efficiently used within scrolling parent. Limited to
1 item view type and item heights have to be uniform regardless of their content.

### Reflection
**KMirror** - interface and utilities for reflecting fields and methods as simple delegates. See demo/tests for sample.

### Service
**BindServiceConnection** - abstract base for service connection implementations.

**DirectBindService** - abstract marker interface for services that can be bound to directly (within same process).
Its companion object contains smart connection factory methods.

**DirectBindService.Impl** - default service implementation that can be extended if possible.

**DirectBindService.LifecycleImpl** - default lifecycle service implementation that can be extended if possible.

**DirectBindService.ConnectionFactory** - connection factory for specific direct bind service class. This can be created or inherited by
that services companion object for convenience.

**LingeringService** - service that auto-starts self to persist for a while after `unbind()`.
Its companion object contains required connection factory methods.

**LingeringService.ConnectionFactory** - connection factory for specific lingering service class. This can be created or inherited by
that services companion object for convenience.

### Transition

Few common transitions and utilities.

### Views

**FixedSizeTextView**, **FixedSizeChronometer** - text views that do not invalidate layout when text is changed.

**ImmersiveConstraintLayout** - holds common logic for keeping layout immersive.

**SaveChildStateLayouts** - logic for containing save state of all children within their parent.  Prevents collision with duplicate view ids within the layout.
