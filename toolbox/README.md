Toolbox
=======
Utility classes / packages.

Most of them are copy-pasteable because they don't have any 
external dependencies. If they require another file it's specified in 
file header.

To import everything, add to **build.gradle** or **build.gradle.kts**:
```gradle    
implementation("com.github.PPaszkiewicz.Tools:toolbox:$version")
```

### Delegate
Various delegates and their factories.

**Context** - lazy context delegates useful for declaring some delegates in fragments.

**Fragment** - delegates for creating/finding existing fragments.

    // inside activity or fragment:
    val myFragment by fragments<MyFragment>()

**Preferences** - delegates for exposing preference values.

    // inside activity or fragment:
    val userPreference by preferences().boolean("key", false)

### DownloadManager
Utilities for querying download progress from systems DownloadManager.

Available as standalone `DownloadProgressObserver` or wrapped with `LiveData`.

### Extensions
Various extensions relating to whatever is in the file name.

### RecyclerView

**GravityGridLayoutManager** - grid layout manager that applies gravity to items instead of putting them at top-start.

**NestedWrapLayoutManager** - linear layout manager that can be efficiently used within scrolling parent. Limited to
1 item view type and item heights have to be uniform regardless of their content.

### Reflection
**KMirror** - interface and utilities for reflecting fields and methods as simple delegates. See demo/tests for sample.

### Transition

Few common transitions and utilities.

### Views

**StableTextView**, **StableChronometer** - text views that do not invalidate layout when text is changed,
useful to prevent excessive layout requests (for example in RecyclerView).

**ImmersiveConstraintLayout** - holds common logic for keeping layout immersive.

**SaveChildStateLayouts** - logic for containing save state of all children within their parent.  Prevents collision with duplicate view ids within the layout.

**TileRenderLinearLayout** - layout that tiles out multiple drawing of its content for "loading" effect.

**orientation** - contains a "compass" and "guides" that help building layouts with selectable orientation.

### ViewBinding
`ViewBinding` delegates for activity, fragments and views that are lifecycle aware so they doen't require any `onDestroyView` overrides.
Sample:

    // inside fragment:
    val binding by viewBinding<MainActivityBinding>()

**ViewBinding** - core methods for delegates.

**ViewTags** - delegates for view tags.

**Reflection** - delegates that are based on reflection so they can work just with class name.
