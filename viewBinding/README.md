ViewBinding
=======
`ViewBinding` delegates for activity, fragments and views that are lifecycle aware so they don't require any `onDestroyView` overrides.

**Fragments:**
 ```kotlin
class MyFragment : Fragment(R.layout.my_fragment) {
    val binding by viewBinding<MyFragmentBinding>()
    //...
}
```

**Activity:**
 ```kotlin
 class MyActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
     val binding by viewBinding<MyActivityBinding>()
     //...
 }
 ```
 
 **DialogFragment:**
  ```kotlin
 class MyDialogFragment : DialogFragment() {
     val binding by dialogViewBinding<MyDialogFragmentBinding>()
     
     override fun onCreateDialog(savedInstanceState: Bundle?): Dialog {
         return AlertDialog.Builder(requireContext(), theme)
             .setTitle("Dialog title")
             .setPositiveButton(android.R.string.ok) { _, _ -> }
             .setView(binding) {
                 textView1.text = "Hello World!"
             }.create()
     }
 }
 ```
