Tools
=====

My personal Kotlin based tools. 

To import ensure you have ```maven { url `jitpack.io` }``` repository in your project level **build.gradle**.

### Coroutines
"Loader" utilities based on coroutines.

Import in **build.gradle** or **build.gradle.kts**:
```gradle
implementation("com.github.PPaszkiewicz.Tools:coroutines:$version")
```
### Toolbox

Mixed bag of kotlin utils. Most files are standalone so they can be copied into a project.

Import in **build.gradle** or **build.gradle.kts**:
```gradle    
implementation("com.github.PPaszkiewicz.Tools:toolbox:$version")
```

### Demo

Demo app for other packages.
