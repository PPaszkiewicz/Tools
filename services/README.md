Services
=======

ServiceConnection implementation that's lifecycle aware and exposes service callbacks in more
understandable way than default.

Import in **build.gradle** or **build.gradle.kts**:
```gradle    
implementation("com.github.PPaszkiewicz.Tools:services:$version")
```

## Basic Usage
1. Have your service extend `DirectBindService.Impl` and create factory in companion object:
 ```kotlin
class YourService : DirectBindService.Impl() {
    companion object {
        val connectionFactory = DirectBindService.ConnectionFactory<YourService>()
    }

    /** service implementation **/
}
 ```
2. Inside your activity create lifecycle aware connection using factory:
```kotlin
class YourActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    val connection = YourService.connectionFactory.lifecycle(this)

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        // inject basic listeners
        connection.onConnect = {
            Log.d("Demo", "Connected to service : $it")
        }
        // rest of onCreate
    }
}
```
This will automatically bind to your service for as long as activity is alive.

For more complex sample see demo package.

## Classes

**BindServiceConnection** - abstract base for service connection implementations.

**BindServiceConnectionCallbacks** - interface for connection callbacks.

**BindServiceConnectionLambdas** - callback interface that defines hot pluggable lambdas instead of methods.

**DirectBindService** - abstract marker interface for services that can be bound to directly (within same process).
Its companion object contains smart connection factory methods.

**DirectBindService.Impl** - default service implementation that can be extended if possible.

**DirectBindService.LifecycleImpl** - default lifecycle service implementation that can be extended if possible.

**DirectBindService.ConnectionFactory** - connection factory for specific direct bind service class. This can be created or inherited by
that services companion object for convenience.

**LingeringService** - service that auto-starts self to persist for a while after `unbind()`.
Its companion object contains required connection factory methods.

**LingeringService.ConnectionFactory** - connection factory for specific lingering service class. This can be created or inherited by
that services companion object for convenience.
